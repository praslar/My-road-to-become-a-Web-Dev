The California Highway Patrol, people who work at a medical center, and a local news station had a special program early one morning. They organized a demonstration in a big parking lot. They showed parents and grandparents how to keep children safe while riding in a car. They showed people how to use children's car seats. The officers and medical experts showed adults how to properly place a car safety seat in an automobile. A safety seat must be tightly fastened so that it will not move.
