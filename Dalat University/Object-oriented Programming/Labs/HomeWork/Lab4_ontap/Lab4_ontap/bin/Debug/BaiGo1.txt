There have been many weeks of rainy weather in one area of California. The rain has a tendency to seep into the cracks of the road. When cars and trucks drive on these wet roads it breaks down the base. This causes potholes to develop. Potholes can cause a lot of damage to cars. Auto repair experts said the holes in the roads have been causing more damage than usual to cars. They said that they have already seen many bent and cracked wheels.
